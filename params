Worm Parameters:

# Don't Change:
Hill Model Parameters:
kM: 
N: 
scale: 

# Don't Change:
num_cells: number of cells
n_GJs: number of gap junctions


# Constant:
cc_env for External ion concentrations

# See Ion Concentrations:
cc_cells for internal ion concentrations


# Look into further.
Ligand creation/decay/gating?

# Change these:
Ion Channel Diffusion Coefficients
GJ_diffusion: Ion diffusion rate through the gap junctions
cell_r: Cell radius
gj_len: Gap Junction Length
# Also randomize on init:
Ion Concentrations:
'M' : The secret molecule
'Na'
'K'
'Cl'
'P'

How to judge living cells:
Vmem: Range of values for liveness. (0 = dead cell - 1)
      Vmem mapping of 0V = Tail, 1V = Head
      Difference between head and tail (magnitude)
      

Mutation:
        - Point-wise mutation of a randomly chosen parameter.
        - Multiply by a random scale factor [e.g. 0.5 - 2]

Crossover:
        - Randomly choose 2 planaria and a parameter to switch
        - Switch parameter(s)

Cull Planaria:
     - If a planaria is 'dead' for more than 2-3 rounds, force repopulation.
     - Cull a certain fixed percentage of the cells, ranked by the selection method.
     - When a planaria is culled, replace it with the crossover copy of 2 random planaria.

If all die, restart from beginning.
